      i. a maximum of one copy of the BlackBerry Dynamics Enterprise Server; and

     ii. a maximum of twenty-five (25) object code copies of the BlackBerry Dynamics Client Libraries;

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, solely for the purpose of developing and testing Applications using Developer Test Data internally within Developer's organization and not for purposes of any distribution to any third party, commercial or otherwise (“Development Usage”). Without limiting the foregoing, any Applications which access or make use of any application program interface that is provided to you in the BlackBerry Dynamics Software may not be installed or used pursuant to the licenses granted hereunder, except in an internal test environment.

    b.  Limited License for BlackBerry Sample Code. Subject to Developer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, BlackBerry hereby grants to Developer a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, nonsublicensable, personal license to create Derivative Works of the BlackBerry Sample Code solely for the purpose of developing and testing Applications.

    c.  Proof of Concept Trials. You may authorize up to a 60-day trial for each of your potential Customers to evaluate the Application, provided that you shall ensure that each Customer shall enable no more than a maximum of twenty-five (25) object code copies of the BlackBerry Dynamics Libraries where each individual copy is embedded within an Application that is in compliance with this Agreement. BlackBerry will cooperate with you regarding the provisioning process for trial accounts.

For clarity, the Developer is not granted any licenses or rights to make any Application available for commercial use by Customers pursuant to this Agreement. Separate terms and conditions shall apply in relation to a Customer’s commercial license and support for Applications.

C. Records and Reconciliation: You will, during the Term and for one (1) year following its termination, create and maintain records regarding your use and distribution of the BlackBerry Dynamics Software and use of the Service, which records shall include, without limitation, each installation of BlackBerry Dynamics Software, distribution of credentials and/or usage of Service under this Agreement (collectively, “Records”). At BlackBerry’s request, you will promptly provide such Records to BlackBerry, for the purpose of verifying compliance with this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between BlackBerry’s records regarding your use of the Software and Services and the Records, BlackBerry’s records shall be deemed to be accurate (unless BlackBerry’s records are definitively proven by you to be incorrect). If you fail to create, maintain or deliver Records as required under this Section or in the event of any dispute as to the accuracy of Records, BlackBerry may audit your use of the BlackBerry Dynamics Software (e.g., via review of copies of applicable server or device log files, etc.), at any location in which it is or has been installed or otherwise utilized by you, subject to your reasonable policies with respect to security and confidentiality.

D. Terms of BlackBerry Dynamics Service: During Development Usage, BlackBerry will provide the Service to the BlackBerry Dynamics Client Libraries licensed for use hereunder; however, the Service will not include performance monitoring. BlackBerry will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) make available the NOC service during 9am to 5pm, Pacific Time and BlackBerry will reserve weekday evenings (continental US time) and weekends for NOC maintenance activities; (b) BlackBerry will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to Developer in advance of any planned maintenance of the NOC; and (c) in the event of any unplanned service degradation, BlackBerry will make commercially reasonable efforts to recover from the event to maintain service availability and to send notice will be sent to Developer during normal coverage hours, or as soon as practical, advising you of any unplanned service degradation. Without limitation, the terms and conditions of any Service provided by BlackBerry to any Customer using the BlackBerry Dynamics Libraries licensed by Developer pursuant to an Embedded Partner Deployment License shall be only those expressly agreed upon between BlackBerry and the relevant Customer.

E.  Support: For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to this Agreement, during Development Usage, BlackBerry will not supply, and Customers are not entitled to, any technical support, warranty or documentation associated with the BlackBerry Dynamics Software from BlackBerry under this Agreement. BlackBerry may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the BlackBerry Dynamics Software or Services provided hereunder at any time without notice, but is under no obligation to do so. If updates are made available to you by BlackBerry, the terms of this Agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that BlackBerry has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the BlackBerry Dynamics Software or to any services to anyone in the future. Without limiting the above, in connection with Development Licenses and/or Development Usage, BlackBerry may (but shall have no obligation pursuant to this Agreement to) provide Developer with web-based maintenance or support regarding, or updates to, the BlackBerry Dynamics Software.  BlackBerry may optionally offer, and Developer may optionally order, extended levels of support for Embedded Partner Deployment License(s). Without limitation, the terms and conditions of any support, warranty or documentation associated with the BlackBerry Dynamics Software provided by BlackBerry to any Customer using the BlackBerry Dynamics Libraries licensed by Developer pursuant to an Embedded Partner Deployment License shall be only those expressly agreed upon between BlackBerry and the relevant Customer.

F.  Open Source Software: To the extent any license to any Open Source Software requires that BlackBerry provide Developer the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Developer in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software. Developer acknowledges and agree that unless otherwise required by the applicable Open Source Software license, each Open Source Software license is solely between Developer and the applicable licensor of the Open Source Software. Developer shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any. If your Application includes any Open Source Software, you agree to comply with all applicable Open Source Software licensing terms. You also agree not to use any Open Source Software in the development of your Application in such a way that would cause the non-Open Source Software portions of the BlackBerry Dynamics Software to be subject to any Open Source Software licensing terms or obligations.

Q. General:

a.  Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement or any of your rights hereunder without BlackBerry’s prior written consent, which consent shall be subject to BlackBerry’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment in breach of this provision will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

b.  Notices. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any notice provided by BlackBerry to you hereunder shall be in writing and delivered electronically to the last e-mail address provided by you to BlackBerry. Electronic notice to you shall be deemed to have been duly given on the date that it was sent. Alternatively, BlackBerry may post notices to you on the BlackBerry Developer Portal.

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, USA (EXCLUDING ITS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS, THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS AND THE UNIFORM COMPUTER INFORMATION TRANSACTION ACT AND ANY ADAPTATION THEREOF). The parties agree that damages will be an inadequate remedy in the case of your breach of certain terms of this Agreement, and that BlackBerry may therefore seek equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have for such breach without the requirement of posting a bond. The prevailing party in any legal action related to this Agreement is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party. You irrevocably consent and attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts located in New York, New York for any claims arising from or related to this Agreement.

You should regularly visit the portal to review the most current version of this Agreement.  Changes to this Agreement will be effective as of the date set forth on the revised Agreement and you agree that your continued use of the Software after the changes become effective shall constitute your acceptance of the revised Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and any documentation used with the Software, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the extent of the inconsistency.

e.  Miscellaneous. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties.

Any ambiguities herein will be clarified in an equitable manner without regard to authorship. The provisions of this Agreement, including any Orders placed hereunder may only be waived or modified in a writing signed by a representative of each party with authority to bind. </string>
